# ADB Web Interface – Demonstration Build

## Overview

This repository contains a **demonstration version** of an ADB-based web interface created to showcase the **system design, deployment strategy, and technical architecture** of the project.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Present the **concept and workflow**
- Demonstrate **cloud deployment practices**
- Highlight **engineering and integration skills**

Some internal logic and unique mechanisms are intentionally **not included** to protect the originality of the project.

## Project Goals

- Enable remote interaction with Android devices using **ADB**
- Provide a **web-based interface** for device monitoring
- Secure access using **private networking (Tailscale)**
- Run reliably on **AWS EC2** using **PM2**

## What Is Intentionally Not Included

To protect the uniqueness of this project, the following components are **not part of this public repository**:

- Core processing logic  
- Internal automation workflows  
- Proprietary parsing and optimization methods  
- Production environment secrets  
- Device-specific tuning logic  

> This repository is meant for **demonstration and evaluation only**, not for full reproduction.

## Deployment

A complete deployment guide is included for **reference purposes**.  
The live system runs on a private AWS EC2 instance and is **not kept online 24/7**.

If you want to deploy your own version:
- Follow the instructions in `DEPLOYMENT.md`
- Replace internal logic with your own implementation
